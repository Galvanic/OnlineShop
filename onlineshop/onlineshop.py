"""
Script to automate who owes what for an online shop (i.e. easily dividing
the bill).

Input:  A .txt file generated by copying the confirmation email content
        into a text file
        Asks who ordered which item
Output: Name of flatmate and amount they owe for that shop.

Future improvements:
- Yahoo Mail API to fetch shop receipt email automatically
- Makes guesses on whose item it is based on previous shop assignments
